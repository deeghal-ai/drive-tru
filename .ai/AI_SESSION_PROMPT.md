# AI Session Starter - Drive Tru Prototype

Copy and paste EVERYTHING below the line when starting a new AI coding session.

## Project Context

You are helping me build a **DESIGN PROTOTYPE** for "Drive Tru" - a pre-owned car marketplace for UAE (Suzuki & Citroen brands under ARTC/Al Rostamani). 

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is NOT a production application.**

This prototype is for:
- Stakeholder presentations
- RFP/proposal effort estimation
- Client discussions and sign-off
- Integration feasibility demonstration

### Prototype Philosophy

```
PROTOTYPE MINDSET:
✅ Visual completeness over code perfection
✅ All features visible (even if mocked)
✅ Realistic mock data over real integrations
✅ Speed over scalability
✅ Hardcoded data is acceptable
✅ Placeholder interactions are fine
✅ Copy-paste from v0.dev encouraged

❌ Don't worry about:
- TypeScript strictness
- Unit tests
- Error boundaries
- Production security
- Database optimization
- Real API integrations
```

## Required Reading (IN ORDER)

1. **`.ai/CONTEXT.md`** - Project state, what's built, tech stack
2. **`.ai/FEATURES.md`** - Complete feature matrix with BUILD/MOCK status
3. **`.ai/V0_PROMPTS.md`** - Ready-to-use v0.dev prompts for components
4. **`.ai/PAGES.md`** - All pages and their requirements

---

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser
http://localhost:3000
```

## Working Rules for Prototype

### When Building UI
1. Check `.ai/V0_PROMPTS.md` for ready-made v0.dev prompts
2. Generate component in v0.dev
3. Copy to project
4. Connect to mock data from `/data/` folder
5. Add minimal interactivity

### When Adding Features
1. Check feature status in `.ai/FEATURES.md`
2. If "BUILD" → Make it functional with mock data
3. If "MOCK" → Make it look real but hardcode behavior
4. If "SKIP" → Don't build, just note in documentation

### Data Strategy
- All mock data lives in `/src/data/` as JSON/TS files
- Use realistic UAE car data (makes, prices in AED, locations)
- Include Arabic translations where shown in UI

### Code Style (Relaxed for Prototype)
- TypeScript with `any` is acceptable
- Inline styles are fine
- Copy-paste duplication is okay
- Comments for "TODO: Production" items

---

## End of Session

Update `.ai/CONTEXT.md`:
- Mark completed pages/features
- Note any blockers
- List next priorities

---

## Today's Session

the images used are not representative of the cars. and there are missing images. can you plan to fix it
# Or push to GitHub and import at vercel.com/new
```

**Reference:** Check `.ai/V0_PROMPTS.md` for component prompts

Start by reading the context files and confirming understanding.
